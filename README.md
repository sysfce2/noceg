# NoCEG - Steamworks CEG DRM Resolver
[![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/iArtorias/noceg/total.svg)](https://github.com/iArtorias/noceg/releases)
> Patch Valve's CEG DRM for legally owned games to ensure long-term accessibility and preservation.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> NoCEG only works with legally owned games. The game executable that Steam downloads only works with your account and system. NoCEG needs that information to work.

> [!CAUTION]
> This should only be used for personal backups. The final executable still has your hardware info, and is illegal to distribute.

## Overview

**NoCEG** is a toolkit designed to fully patch out Valve’s **CEG (Custom Executable Generation)** DRM from *legally purchased* Steam games. Its main purpose is **digital preservation** ensuring that games remain playable even after CEG servers are no longer available.

---

## Components

This repository includes **three core tools** required for resolving and patching CEG protection:

### 🔍 `noceg_signatures`
> A command-line tool to scan the executable for CEG related functions and export the required information to `noceg.json`.

### 🧠 `noceg`
> A dynamic library that uses the vectored exception handling to resolve CEG protected functions (both constant and stolen/masked ones) during runtime using the data from the previously generated `noceg.json`.

### 🧰 `noceg_patcher`
> An utility that applies the final patch to a CEG protected executable.

---

## 🛠️ Usage

### **1. Download the latest release**

Get the latest binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/iArtorias/noceg/releases) page.

---

### **2. Signature extraction**
Run the following command:
```bash
noceg_signatures.exe "Path\To\GameExecutable.exe"
```

Or simply **drag and drop** the executable onto `noceg_signatures.exe`.

> 🔔 **Note**: If the target executable has **ASLR** enabled, the tool will create a new binary named `<original>_noaslr.exe`. Use this in the next steps.

---

### **3. Inject the runtime library**

- Rename the original `steam_api.dll` to `steam_api_org.dll`.
- Copy `steam_api.dll` from the NoCEG package into the game’s directory.
- Place the generated `noceg.json` file into the same folder.

Now, launch the game. A confirmation window should appear:
> ✅ **"Successfully finished the task!"**

### ⚠️ Special case for select games: `ShouldRestart` option

The following games require `ShouldRestart` to be set to `true` in `noceg.json`:

- Homefront  
- The Darkness II  
- Star Trek  
- F.E.A.R. 3  
- Risen 2

To enable this option, replace this:

```json
"ShouldRestart": false
```
with
```json
"ShouldRestart": true
```

---

### **4. Final Patching**

Drag the original executable onto `noceg_patcher.exe`.  
A modified version will be generated with a suffix like `_noceg.exe` or `_noceg.dll`.

---

### **5. Cleanup**

- Delete `NoCEG`’s `steam_api.dll`.
- Rename `steam_api_org.dll` back to `steam_api.dll`.
